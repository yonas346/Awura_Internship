##  What I Accomplished This Week

## 1.  Conditional statements

- Designed and implemented the "if Statements" for conditional task execution.
- Integrated "for Statements" to iterate over task lists efficiently.
- Utilized the "range() Function" for sequential task processing.
- Implemented "break and continue Statements" to control loop flow.
- Added "else Clauses on Loops" for post-loop actions.
- Incorporated "pass Statements" as placeholders for future features.
- Developed "match Statements" for pattern-based task handling.
